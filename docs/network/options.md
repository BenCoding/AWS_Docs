### Options

=== "Region"

    1. **What**? Several datacenters nearby/grouped in a region in the world (US EAST, EU WEST)
    2. **How**? Amazon independently maps zones to identifiers for each account. 

        1. This means the us-east-1a availability zone for one account may not be backed by the same data centers as us-east-1a for another account.

        2. Morbi eget dapibus felis. Vivamus venenatis porttitor tortor sit amet
        rutrum. Pellentesque aliquet quam enim, eu volutpat urna rutrum a.

            1. Mauris dictum mi lacus
            2. Ut sit amet placerat ante
            3. Suspendisse ac eros arcu

=== "AZ "

    1. **What**? One or more data centers (in a Region)
    2. **How**? Amazon independently maps zones to identifiers for each account. 

        1. This means the us-east-1a availability zone for one account may not be backed by the same data centers as us-east-1a for another account.

        1. Morbi eget dapibus felis. Vivamus venenatis porttitor tortor sit amet
        rutrum. Pellentesque aliquet quam enim, eu volutpat urna rutrum a.

## When Fargate is better

1. If you don't want to rearchitect you app, and want to lift and shift quickly.
2. You need to scale (small to medium*)
3. You can't deal with cold-starts
4. You are doing large batch processing with high compute needs (Use Fargate Spot)

### Pluses and Minuses

| Positives (+):      | Negatives (-):            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Less Complexity     | Higher Costs (Maybe)      |
| Better Security     | Less Customization        |
| Lower Costs (Maybe) | Limited Regions Available |

!!! abstract "Fargate Cost Calculator"
    [Fargate Cost Calculator](https://www.fargate.org/) - <https://www.fargate.org/>

!!! question "Faragate Consideration"
    *Fargate has had some issues for us when tried scaling very quickly at very large scales.
    Our docker repo was on-prem, and we've switched over to using AWS's native ECR (Docker Container Registry)
    This has improved performance. We've found problems as Fargate takes a while to spin up a new task.

### Resilency

Do you need Fargate in Multi-AZ?

## When Lambda is better

1. Cost-sensitivity
2. Spoardic workloads
3. Processing batches takes less than 15 minutes

!!! warning "Lambda Constraints"
    15 min per invocation for a lambda

### Example Usage

For example you could rearchitect your react app (front-end) to work within a lambda
The lambda could then call a CMS content api (back-end)
Your remaining static assets could live on a S3 bucket.

This architect is highly scaleable, cost-effective.
The challenge: it may require significant rearchitecture from your current solution.

### Lambda Considerations

1. Can you replace EC2/ECS with lambda?
2. Portability
3. Environment control
4. Trigger type
5. Response time
6. Response size
7. Process time
8. Memory usage
9. What's the size of your lambda?
10. How fast does scaling need to happen?
11. Max run time?
12. What kind of processing are you doing?

Lambda largely operates based on **trigger events** that originate in other system

!!! warning "Lambda Constraints"
    1. **15 min** per invocation for a lambda
    2. Even using S3, you're limited to **50MB** for lambda code

!!! tip "ðŸ’¡ Architecture Ideas"
    1. Idea: Main Lambda could trigger queue then process w/ further child lambdas"
